         <div class="section-content">
           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             In 2011, after completing a basic Java programming course in high school, I
             stumbled upon iOS development as a senior project. After a short amount of
             research, I cultivated a passion and was instantly fascinated by the 
             design opportunities Apple had enabled for its developers. Welcome to iOS 4...

             <br><br>

             After many voluntary, repetitive nights up late learning the full scope of iOS SDK,
             I was proudly able to launch my first application worldwide in the App Store prior to
             graduation. The product? Sand Sketch. The purpose? A graphical sketching application
             to send picture messages which replicated finger drawing in the sand.

             <br><br>

             Nine years later, I continue to be the same ambitious and charismatic iOS developer.
             I gravitate towards new opportunities that allow me to bond with the
             product on a personal level. My philosophy is believing all applications
             should instill a joyful experience in the end user through functional and aesthetic
             layouts, trusted performance, simplistic navigation, and most importantly - a memorable solution!

             <br><br>

             For my career, I am currently employed by General Electric as a Software Engineer. My responsiblity
             includes designing, developing, and validating Java and Python-based applications for
             advanced controls power plant turbomachinery. Beyond my career, the extent of my practical iOS development
             has been a combination of freelancing, consulting, and personal endeavors.

         <div class="spaced-lineage" style="font-size:16px; padding: 20px;">
           As I'm always eagerly looking to create new applications to meet the
           needs of family, friends, and clients, the projects below highlight a
           more personal journey through some of my most unique projects, their purpose,
           architecture, and the passion and inspiration which brought them to life.
         </div>

         <div class="section-project">Scout (2020)</div>

         <div class="section-content" style="padding-bottom: 25px;">

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             <h3>Purpose</h3>
             Scout is an up-and-coming native iOS application that serves as a
             location-based food and drink forum. It openly collects data provided by
             users and/or private venues and businesses to deliver information about live
             and local specials, deals, and fun events to the local communities.
           </div>

           <div class="vertical-rule" style="height: 150px;"></div>

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             <h3>Architecture</h3>
             This project utilizes Swift 5.0 with SwiftUI. User authentication and data
             are managed using Google Firebase (Cloud Firestore) and notifications
             are managed using the OneSignal API.

            </div>

         </div>

         <div class="spaced-lineage" style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
           <h3>Inspiration</h3>
           This app was purely inspired by that all-too-familiar moment of absent-minded silence
           which often follows when asking simple questions such as:
           <br><br>

           <i>"What do we want to do today?"</i>
           <br>
           <i>"Where do we go for happy hour or dinner?"</i>
           <br>
           <i>"What fun events are happening around town?"</i>

           <br><br>

           My vision for Scout is allowing a major user base to access free and accurate
           information for what is happening around them. Unlike Facebook and Yelp, Scout aims
           to dive into the nooks and crannies of what makes a business unique and special
           and highlight these qualities. During the Covid-19 outbreak, I found a deeper passion to
           accelerate development to help small businesses stay on their feet and bring the local
           communities together. Information is a powerful tool and nothing would
           make me happier than bringing joy to those who can discover something new,
           make a memory with friends and family, and maybe save a buck or two in the process.

         <div class="spaced-lineage" style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
           <h3>Inspiration</h3>
           Two weeks leading up to a half marathon, I was searching the App Store
           for a minimal iOS + watchOS race pace application which provided flexible
           choices for viewing pacing per mile versus target time goals. When
           my search came up short, I took an impromptu shot at creating my own application.
           Three days later, it was complete, I was satisfied, and I submitted it
           to the App Store for others to enjoy. Since submission, it was been downloaded
           over 1,200 times with over 60,000 user impressions without any marketing campaign.

         <div class="section-content" style="padding-bottom: 25px;">

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             <h3>Purpose</h3>
             Blue Ink is a native iOS application which serves as a minimal dashboard
             for managing shopping and to-do lists. Whether creating, editing,
             or sharing lists, Blue Ink allows users to simulatenously work together to
             complete lists across multiple devices in real time.

         <div class="spaced-lineage" style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
           <h3>Inspiration</h3>
           We've all seen the Facebook groups about people claiming what they're
           going to bring to a party, yet we still have to scroll to ensure duplicates aren't
           brought and something isn't forgotten. We've also been in a grocery store with friends
           or family and really wished we could "divide and conquer" to complete the shopping on
           a tight time schedule. This continual situation soon sparked my inspiration for Blue Ink.
           Sadly, the project was indefinitely delayed to focus on my graduate schooling and career.
