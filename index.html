         <div class="section-content">
           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             In 2011, after completing a basic Java programming course in high school, I
             stumbled upon iOS development as a senior project. After a short amount of
             research, I cultivated a passion and was instantly fascinated by the vast ocean of
             design Apple provided for its developers. Welcome to iOS 4...

             <br><br>

             After many voluntary, countless nights up late learning the nooks
             and crannies of the iOS SDK, I was proudly able to launch my first application
             worldwide in the App Store prior to graduation. The product? Sand Sketch.
             The purpose? A graphical sketching application to send messages to friends
             which replicated finger drawing in the sand.

             <br><br>

             Nine years later, I continue to be the same ambitious and charismatic iOS developer.
             I gravitate towards new opportunities that allow me to bond with the
             product on a personal level. My philosophy is believing all applications
             should instill a joyful experience in the end user through functional and aesthetic
             layouts, trusted performance, simplistic navigation, and most importantly - a memorable solution!

             <br><br>

             For my career, I am currently employed by General Electric as a Software Engineer. My responsiblity
             includes designing, developing, and validating Java and Python-based applications for
             advanced control power plant turbomachinery.

         <div class="section-header">iOS Portfolio</div>

         <div class="spaced-lineage" style="font-size:16px; padding: 20px;">
           As I'm always eagerly looking to create new applications to meet the
           needs of family, friends, and clients, the projects below highlight a
           personal journey through some of my most unique projects, how they started,
           my passion towards them, and their end result.
         </div>

         <div class="section-project">Scout (2020)</div>

         <div class="section-content" style="padding-bottom: 25px;">

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             <h3>Purpose</h3>
             Scout is an up-and-coming native iOS application that serves as a
             location-based food and drink forum. It openly collects data from
             users and private venues/businesses to deliver live and local specials,
             deals, fun events to users. Coming soon!
           </div>

           <div class="vertical-rule" style="height: 150px;"></div>

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             <h3>Architecture</h3>
             This project utilizes Swift 5.0 with the SwiftUI. User authentication
             is managed using Cloud Firestore (Google Firebase) and notifications
             are managed using OneSignal.

           </div>

         <img class="image" src="images/Scout@2x.png?raw=true"/>

         <div class="spaced-lineage" style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
           <h3>Inspiration</h3>
           This app was purely inspired by the silent feeling followed by asking simple
           questions which should somehow have simple answers:
           <br><br>

           <i>"What do we want to do today?"</i>
           <br>
           <i>"Where do we go for happy hour?"</i>
           <br>
           <i>"What fun events are happening around town?"</i>

           <br><br>
           Seven days a week, this problem is common. It is the reason
           why asking your girlfriends or wife where they want to eat is always so
           difficult. It is the reason why you always end up going to your same spot,
           even though deep down you wish you could discover something new. Traditions
           are valuable, but new traditions are always meant to be made.

           <br><br>

           My vision for Scout is allowing a major user base to access free and accurate
           information for what is happening around them. Unlike Facebook and Yelp, Scout aims
           to dive into the nooks and crannies of what makes a business unique and special
           and highlight these qualities. During the Covid-19 outbreak, I found a more inspiring passion to
           accelerate development to help small businesses stay on their feet and bring the local
           communities together. Information is a powerful tool and nothing would
           make me happier than bringing joy to those who can discover something new,
           make a memory with friends and family, and maybe save a buck or two in the process.

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">

             Live worldwide in the App Store (for free), Pace Chase is a native

             calculator for runners of all levels. Available on iOS and watchOS!

           <h3>Inspiration</h3>
           Two weeks leading up to a half marathon, I was searching the App Store
           for a minimal iOS + watchOS race pace application which provided flexible
           choices for viewing pacing per mile, but also hitting target times. When
           my search came up short, I took an impromptu shot at creating my own application.
           Three days later, it was complete, I was satisfied, and I even submitted it
           to the App Store for others to enjoy. Since submission, it was been downloaded
           over 1,200 times with over 60,000 user impressions.

         <div class="section-content" style="padding-bottom: 25px;">

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             <h3>Purpose</h3>
             Blue Ink is a native iOS application which serves as a minimal dashboard
             for managing shopping and to-do lists. Whether creating, editing,
             or sharing lists, Blue Ink allows users to simulatenously work to
             complete lists across multiple users in realtime.

           <div class="spaced-lineage" style="width: 40%;">
             <h3>Architecture</h3>
             This project utilized Swift 3.0 with UIKit. User authentication

             were managed using OneSignal.

         <div class="spaced-lineage" style="padding: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
           <h3>Inspiration</h3>
           We've all seen the Facebook groups about people claiming what they're
           going to bring to a party, yet we have to scroll to ensure duplicates aren't
           brought and something isn't forgotten. We've also been in the position to where
           you've been into a grocery store with friends or family and really wished
           you could "divide and conquer" to complete the shopping on a tight time schedule.
           This continual situation soon sparked my inspiration for Blue Ink. Sadly, the
           project was indefinitely delay to focus on my graduate school.
